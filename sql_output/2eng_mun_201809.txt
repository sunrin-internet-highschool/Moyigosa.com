Dear Mr. Terry Walter, I am the principal of Springfield Public School. As you
know, Springfield Public School is located at the intersection
of First Street and Pine Street. The safety of our children
is at risk largely due to the disregard for speed limits by
motorists traveling along Pine Street. I have regularly
witnessed vehicles traveling far in excess of the speed limit on Pine Street. Additionally, parents have expressed concern for the safety of their children who must cross Pine Street.
For these reasons, we are requesting the installation of
speed bumps on Pine Street. I know that one of your
missions, as well as ours, is to ensure that our young
people are afforded a safe and secure environment to and
from school each day. I anticipate that your approval of this
request will greatly improve the safety of our children.
Sincerely,
Emma Hudson

 Rivera, who was closest to the dispenser, spun around. He

 When you enter a store, what do you see? It is quite
likely that you will see many options and choices. It doesn’t
matter whether you want to buy tea, coffee, jeans, or a phone. In all these situations, we are basically flooded with
options from which we can choose. What will happen if we ask someone, whether online or offline, if he or she prefers
having more alternatives or less? The majority of people
will tell us that they prefer having more alternatives. This
finding is interesting because, as science suggests, the more options we have, the harder our decision making process will
be. The thing is that when the amount of options exceeds a certain level, our decision making will start to suffer. ① 공정한 거래는 경제 정의 실현에 기여한다. ② 신중한 선택으로 불필요한 소비를 줄일 수 있다. ③ 구매 방법에 따라 제품에 대한 만족도가 달라진다. ④ 선택의 폭이 넓어질수록 의사 결정은 더 어려워진다. ⑤ 생산과정의 투명성 확보는 소비자의 권리를 증진시킨다.

 What we need in education is not measurement,
accountability, or standards. While these can be useful tools
for improvement, they should hardly occupy center stage.
Our focus should instead be on making sure we are giving our youth an education that is going to arm them to save humanity. We are faced with unprecedented perils, and these
perils are multiplying and pushing at our collective gates.
We should be bolstering curriculum that helps young people
mature into ethical adults who feel a responsibility to the
global community. Without this sense of responsibility we have seen that many talented individuals give in to their
greed and pride, and this destroys economies, ecosystems,
and entire species. While we certainly should not abandon
efforts to develop standards in different content areas, and
also strengthen the STEM subjects, we need to take
seriously our need for an education centered on global
responsibility. If we don’t, we risk extinction.* bolster: 강화하다

 Although we don’t know the full neurological effects of
digital technologies on young children’s development, we do
know that all screen time is not created equal. For example,
reading an e­book, videoconferencing with grandma, or showing your child a picture you just took of them is not
the same as the passive, television­watching screen time
that concerns many parents and educators. So, rather than
focusing on how much children are interacting with screens,
parents and educators are turning their focus instead to
what children are interacting with and who is talking with
them about their experiences. Though parents may be
tempted to hand a child a screen and walk away, guiding
children’s media experiences helps them build important 21st
Century skills, such as critical thinking and media literacy. ① the predictors of children’s screen media addiction

 Many parents do not understand why their teenagers
occasionally behave in an irrational or dangerous way. At
times, it seems like teens don’t think things through or fully
consider the consequences of their actions. Adolescents
differ from adults in the way they behave, solve problems,
and make decisions. There is a biological explanation for
this difference. Studies have shown that brains continue to
mature and develop throughout adolescence and well into
early adulthood. Scientists have identified a specific region
of the brain that is responsible for immediate reactions
including fear and aggressive behavior. This region develops
early. However, the frontal cortex, the area of the brain that
controls reasoning and helps us think before we act,
develops later. This part of the brain is still changing and
maturing well into adulthood. * frontal cortex: 전두엽

 A phenomenon in social psychology, the Pratfall Effect

celebrities are generally considered to be competent
individuals, and often even presented as flawless or perfect
in certain aspects, committing blunders will make one’s
humanness endearing to others. Basically, those who never make mistakes are perceived as being less attractive and
“likable” than those who make occasional mistakes.
Perfection, or the attribution of that quality to individuals,
(B) [creates / narrows] a perceived distance that the general
public cannot relate to ― making those who never make

of saying “gravy?” with a rising intonation, the Asian
assistants would say “gravy” with a falling intonation, which

general, was recorded in Latin ― a language that no one spoke any longer and that had to be learned in schools.
Very few individuals, probably less than one percent, had
the means to study Latin enough to read books in that
language and therefore to participate in the intellectual
discourse of the times. Moreover, few people had access to
books, which were handwritten, scarce, and expensive. The
great explosion of scientific creativity in Europe was certainly helped by the sudden spread of information brought
about by Gutenberg’s use of movable type in printing and by
the legitimation of everyday languages, which rapidly
replaced Latin as the medium of discourse. In
sixteenth­century Europe it became much easier to make a creative contribution not necessarily because more creative
individuals were born then than in previous centuries or because social supports became more favorable, but because

 Calling your pants “blue jeans” almost seems redundant
because practically all denim is blue. While jeans are probably the most versatile pants in your wardrobe, blue
actually isn’t a particularly neutral color.
 (A) The natural indigo dye used in the first jeans, on the other
hand, would stick only to the outside of the threads. When
the indigo­dyed denim is washed, tiny amounts of that dye
get washed away, and the thread comes with them.
 (B) Ever wonder why it’s the most commonly used hue? Blue was the chosen color for denim because of the chemical
properties of blue dye. Most dyes will permeate fabric in
hot temperatures, making the color stick.
 (C) The more denim was washed, the softer it would get,
eventually achieving that worn­in, made­just­for­me

 Your concepts are a primary tool for your brain to
guess the meaning of incoming sensory inputs.
 (A) When Westerners hear Indonesian gamelan music for the
first time, which is based on seven pitches per octave
with varied tunings, it’s more likely to sound like noise.
A brain that’s been wired by listening to twelve­tone
scales doesn’t have a concept for that music.
 (B) All people of Western culture with normal hearing have a concept for this ubiquitous scale, even if they can’t
explicitly describe it. Not all music uses this scale, however.
 (C) For example, concepts give meaning to changes in sound
pressure so you hear them as words or music instead
of random noise. In Western culture, most music is
based on an octave divided into twelve equally spaced
pitches: the equal­tempered scale codified by Johann
Sebastian Bach in the 17th century.

However, when a bill was introduced in Congress to
outlaw such rules, the credit card lobby turned its
attention to language. Framing matters in many domains. (①) When credit
cards started to become popular forms of payment in the
1970s, some retail merchants wanted to charge different
prices to their cash and credit card customers. (②) To
prevent this, credit card companies adopted rules that
forbade their retailers from charging different prices to cash
and credit customers. (③) Its preference was that if a company charged different prices to cash and credit
customers, the credit price should be considered the
“normal” (default) price and the cash price a discount ―
rather than the alternative of making the cash price the
usual price and charging a surcharge to credit card
customers. (④) The credit card companies had a good

This allows the solids to carry the waves more easily

place your ear flat on top of the table or desk. (①) With

(③) Sound waves are capable of traveling through many
solid materials as well as through air. (④) Solids, like
wood for example, transfer the sound waves much better
than air typically does because the molecules in a solid

outcomes through their own efforts. ①With rare exception,
this is not true of film, novels, or television. ②Readers and
viewers of these other media follow along, reacting to the
story and its twists and turns, without having a direct
personal impact on the events they witness. ③In the same manner, video games can have a negative impact on spending habits if players buy many game­related items and
continually upgrade software and hardware packages. ④In
games, players have the unique ability to control what
unfolds. ⑤As Sid Meier, a game designer, once said, “A
good game is a series of interesting choices.”

 A primary school teacher is helping students to
understand fractional parts by using what she thinks is a commonplace reference. “Today, we’re going to talk about
cutting up a Thanksgiving holiday favorite ― pumpkin pie.”
She continues with an explanation of parts. Well into her
discourse, a young African American boy, looking puzzled,
asks, “What is pumpkin pie?” Most African Americans are
likely to serve sweet potato pie for holiday dinners. In
fact, one of the ways that African American parents
explain pumpkin pie to their children is to say that it is
something like sweet potato pie. For them, sweet potato
pie is the common referent. Even the slight difference of
being unfamiliar with pumpkin pie can serve as a source of interference for the student. Rather than be engaged
actively in the lesson, he may have been preoccupied
with trying to imagine pumpkin pie: What does it taste
like? How does it smell? Is its texture chunky like apple or cherry pie? In the mind of a child, all of these
questions can become more of the focus than the subject
of fractions that the teacher is attempting to teach. * fraction: 분수

 In 2000, James Kuklinski of the University of Illinois led an influential experiment in which more than 1,000 Illinois
residents were asked questions about welfare. More than
half indicated that they were confident that their answers were correct ― but in fact, only three percent of the people
got more than half of the questions right. Perhaps more disturbingly, the ones who were the most confident they were right were generally the ones who knew the least
about the topic. Kuklinski calls this sort of response the “I
know I’m right” syndrome. “It implies not only that most
people will resist correcting their factual beliefs,” he wrote,
“but also that the very people who most need to correct
them will be least likely to do so.”
 How can we have things so wrong and be so sure that
we’re right? Part of the answer lies in the way our brains are wired. Generally, people tend to seek ________________. There is a substantial body of psychological research
showing that people tend to interpret information with an eye toward reinforcing their preexisting views. If we believe something about the world, we are more likely to
passively accept as truth any information that confirms our beliefs, and actively dismiss information that doesn’t. This
is known as “motivated reasoning.” Whether or not the
consistent information is accurate, we might accept it as fact, as confirmation of our beliefs. This makes us more confident in said beliefs, and even less likely to entertain
facts that contradict them.

[43~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. (A)
 Once, there were two woodcutters ― a young, strong one and an old one ― cutting down trees in a jungle. The young man was very hardworking. On his first day, (a) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span> worked
through his break time and complained that the old man was wasting time, taking several breaks to eat and drink.
That day, the young woodcutter brought 15 trees to their
boss. “Fantastic!” the boss said. “Keep up the great work!”
(B)
 It was as if the old man worked through the break time
just as (b) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span> did. So, the young woodcutter decided to
work harder the next day. Unfortunately, the results were even worse. “I must be losing my strength,” the young man thought. One day, the old man invited him for a drink
during the break time. The young man refused and said he
had no extra time. Then, the old man smiled and said to
him, “It is a waste of effort to keep chopping trees without
re­sharpening your axe. Sooner or later, you will have to
give up because you’ve spent too much energy.”
(C)
 Highly motivated by his words, the young woodcutter
tried harder the next day, but (c) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span> could only bring ten
trees. The third day he tried even harder, but he was only
able to bring seven trees. Day after day, he was bringing
less and less trees. As time went by, (d) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span> noticed that even though he worked through his break time and hardly
took a rest, the old woodcutter was cutting down the same amount of trees as him ― and sometimes chopped down even more. (D)
 Suddenly the young woodcutter realized that during break
times while the old man was having a drink, he was also
re­sharpening his axe, which the young woodcutter never did. That’s how (e) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span> could chop more than the young man
in less time! The old man said that we all need time to
relax, to think and meditate, and to learn and grow. If we don’t take the time to sharpen the “axe,” we will become
dull and lose our effectiveness.
